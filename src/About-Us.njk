      <p class="text-muted text-center mb-4">
        At Diamonds in the Ruff, everything we do is rooted in one belief: every senior dog deserves a soft place to land and a family to call their own.
      </p>
      <div class="card border-light shadow-sm p-4">
        <p class="mb-3">The nonprofit was born out of a deep concern for the growing number of older dogs left behind in shelters — overlooked simply because of their age. We saw loyal, loving animals spending their final years in cages instead of cozy homes, and we knew something had to change. That's when we created a platform dedicated entirely to senior dogs.</p>
        <p class="mb-3">Each week, we partner with local shelters to feature five senior dogs most in need of adoption. These dogs are selected by the shelter staff themselves based on factors like age, how long they've been in the shelter, and their risk of euthanasia. By highlighting them front and center, we give them a real chance at finding a family who sees their value.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Senior dogs may have a little gray on their muzzle, but they bring a calm, gentle energy to a home. Many are already house-trained, know basic commands, and just want a warm bed and someone to love. They make incredible companions — especially for older adults or families seeking a mellow, affectionate pet. When you adopt a senior dog, you're not just saving a life — you're gaining a best friend with a heart full of gratitude.</p>
